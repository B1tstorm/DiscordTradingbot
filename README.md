# Discord Tradingbot
Tradingbot which was written in Java for a university project. The Tradingbot can autonomous trade, buy and sell in Discord channels.

This project is our solution for a software engineering class.
For maintainable code we used some design patterns like the observer pattern.
For good teamwork and documentation we used Jira and Confluence. We worked agile and developed a workflow how we want to work with Git.
Tools like visual paradigm and others helped us to create UML diagramms to bring the idea to paper.
